### Compilation

Run the following commands:

```
wget ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/freeradius/freeradius-server-3.0.20.tar.bz2
tar -xjf freeradius-server-3.0.20.tar.bz2
cd freeradius-server-3.0.20/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng/master/patches/wpe/freeradius-wpe/freeradius-wpe.patch
patch -Np1 -i freeradius-wpe.patch
./configure
make
make install
ldconfig
```

## Running

Start ```radiusd``` in a terminal:

```
radiusd -s -X
```

If it fails running and complains about OpenSSL being vulnerable, make sure OpenSSL is up to date. If you are using a recent distribution, most likely OpenSSL is patched, and you can safely allow it. In order to do so, edit /usr/local/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf and change ```allow_vulnerable_openssl``` from ```no``` to ```'CVE-2016-6304'``` (with the single quotes).

Now, connect a client. Once a username/password is entered and the certificate accepted, information regarding that session will be stored in ```/usr/local/var/log/radius/freeradius-server-wpe.log```.

**Note**: This file won't be created until the first client connects and authenticates to the access point.
