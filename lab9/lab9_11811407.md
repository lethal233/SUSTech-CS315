## Task1

I follow the instructions in the lab step by step, and finally I have modified the file `zzz`.

When running the `attack_cow.c`:

Then we can observe that the file `zzz` has been modified in the first screenshot.

### Exploit process

`mmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED,f,0)` is a system call to map files or devices into memory. Default mapping type is file-backed mapping, which maps an area of a process’s virtual memory to files; reading from the mapped area causes the file to be read.

- 1st arg: Starting address for the mapped memory
- 2nd arg: Size of the mapped memory
- 3rd arg: If the memory is readable or writable. Should match the access type
  from Line ①
- 4th arg: If an update to the mapping is visible to other processes mapping the same region and if the update is carried through to the underlying file
- 5th arg: File that needs to be mapped
- 6th arg: Offset indicating from where inside the file the mapping should start.

`memcpy()` is a function to read and write the mapped memory.

`madvise()` is a system call to advise the linux kernel how to deal with the memory.

For Copy-On-Write, three important steps are performed:

- Make a copy of the mapped memory
- Update the page table, so the virtual memory points to newly created physical memory 
- Write to the memory.

The above steps are not atomic in nature: they can be interrupted by other threads which creates a potential race condition.

So we need to run two threads

- Thread 1: write to the mapped memory using write()
- Thread 2: discard the private copy of the mapped memory

We need to race these threads against each other so that they can influence the output.

## Task2

### First add a user charlie

```bash
sudo adduser charlie
```

In the following screenshot we can see that the UID is `1001`.

### Then to modify the cow_attack.c

There are 3 parts needed to be modified.

The first is in the `main()`. To modify the file path to `/etc/passwd`.

The second is to find `charlie:x:1001` in the function `strstr()`.

The third is to modify the UID to `0000`.

### Hack success

In the following picture we can see that `charlie` has `root` privileges.

## Interesting observations

From the dirty-cow attack I learned that if we operate the system call function we must keep it thread-safe. That is, we must keep the procedure not interrupted by other threads.
